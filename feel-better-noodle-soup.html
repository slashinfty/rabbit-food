    <p>When I became a vegetarian, there were very few foods I felt I'd be "missing out on." I simply didn't have a desire to eat meat anymore, so meat-based foods just didn't matter all that much. An exception to this was chicken noodle soup, not so much for the soup itself, but for the comforting sensation it always brought to me when I ate it. Nailing down a satisfactory imitation was therefore very important to me, but I think that with this recipe, I've done more than that. I think this recipe doesn't just stand up to most chicken noodle soups out there, I think it surpasses them. It's rich and full of flavor, and brings a sensation of warmth not just to your mouth but to your soul.</p>
